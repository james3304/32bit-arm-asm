In the sum nine example section 13.2 of the Plantz website 
(https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/sec-arg-access.html) 
here is a sumNine example that demonstrates the passing of 9 
parameters from a 'caller' function to a 'called' function. 
A simplied version is attached to the dropbox. 
There are 2 files needed :

callSumNine.s
sumNine.s

compile with :

gcc -g callSumNine.s sumNine.s -o callSumNine

For this lab, you are to complete the attached worksheet. 
While completeing the worksheet, notice how the none parameters 
are stored and how and where the nine parameters are passed to 
the called function.
