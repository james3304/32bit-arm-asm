COSC2425 : Fall 2023
Lab05 : Selection w/Branching

Introduction:

In this lab, you are provided starter source code: branchDemo2.s and lesser.s.

When assembled, branchDemo2 passes 3 integers to a function named lesser. the function lesser determines and returns which one of the 3 parameters has the least value.

Requirements:

Modify the caller and called functions to do the opposite of current code.

1) Add a greater function to the functions.s source file
2) Send the same 3 parameters to the new greater function
3) The greater function should then decide which of the 3 parameters has a greater value
4) The greater function should then return that value to the caller function ( main )

NOTE:

For this lab, and those going forward, submit your lab solution files to the eCamous dropbox. For now, you should probably just copy / paste from your nano session to a text file on your laptop / desktop and post that.
